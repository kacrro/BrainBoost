                <strong>Normal Mode</strong> â€” Targets are larger. Complete the round by hitting 20 targets. Your average reaction time is tracked.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Precision Mode</strong> â€” Targets are smaller, challenging your accuracy. Complete the round by hitting 20 targets and see your average reaction time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Speed Mode</strong> â€” Targets appear briefly in standard size. The round lasts 20 seconds, and a fixed target duration is shown.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Hardcore Mode</strong> â€” Targets are as small as in Precision mode and appear very briefly. The round lasts 20 seconds, with a fixed target appearance time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Aim accurately</strong> â€” Every hit increases your score, while misses lower your accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Monitor your stats</strong> â€” At the end of each round, review your score, accuracy, total clicks, missed clicks, and reaction time or target duration.
