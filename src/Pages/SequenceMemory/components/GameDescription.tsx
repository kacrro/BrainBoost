            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Repeat the sequence</strong> â€” After each completed sequence another square gets added, making it longer and harder to remember. Try to keep up!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Be precise</strong> â€” The moment you click the wrong square the game ends, giving you a score based on the number of squares you managed to remember.
